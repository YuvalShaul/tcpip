# Partition That

You have received a single CIDR block.  
You have to partition that in the following way:  

- The initial block (we'll call it B):  
**87.87.0.0/18**
  - **Answer**: how many addresses are in this block?
  - **Answer**: what is the broadcast address of the block?
- Split the block into 4 CIDR blocks (let's call them B1, B2, B3, B4)
  - **Answer**: write the network address and the broadcast address of each block.  
  - **Answer**: how many addresses are in each block?
- Split block B3 into 8 networks (let's call them B31,B32,B33,B34,B35,B36,B37,B38) 
- Split B37 into 4 networks (B371, B372, B373, B374)
  - **Answer**: Write the network and broadcast address of each one
